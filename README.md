## exercices-b2expand

In this repository, you will find contracts I wrote to learn Solidity. In each folder, I put the contract's code, a README.md file explaining the tests made on the Ropsten testnet, and the ABI structure of the contracts which is needed to interact with the contract.

To make theses tests, I used the following accounts:

* Account1: [0xb56551f9d17f8ff809a2975ce5da16cbc911aa90](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xb56551f9d17f8ff809a2975ce5da16cbc911aa90)
* Account2: [0x86f3af5490258c386eafd41beeffc998d17f505e](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x86f3af5490258c386eafd41beeffc998d17f505e)
* Account3: [0xe58f20acec3cfaa3f00cf6bce66fc048df884f89](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xe58f20acec3cfaa3f00cf6bce66fc048df884f89)

###  Part1
Deploying a ERC20 token.
	
###  Part2
An ICO contract selling this token.

###  Part3
A proxy contract to invest in the ICO.

###  Part4
An improvement of the proxy contract using payment channels.

###  Part5
An improvement of the proxy contract (and some changes in the ICO contract) to allow a Re-entrancy attack.
